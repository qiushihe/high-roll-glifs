Markdown is intended to be as easy-to-read and easy-to-write as is feasible.

Readability, however, is emphasized above all else.

A Markdown-formatted document should be publishable as-is, as plain text, without looking like it's
been marked up with tags or formatting instructions.

however, is emphasized above all else. A Markdown-formatted document _should be **publishable**
as-is_, as plain text, without looking like it's been marked up with tags or formatting
instructions.
